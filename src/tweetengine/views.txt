=========================
Example application views
=========================

We use webtest to test browser views.

    >>> from webtest import TestApp

Get the application that is normally started via the appserver.

    >>> from tweetengine import application as app

And create a testing app.

    >>> app = TestApp(app)


We have one view to test - the actual start page. It returns very
impressive contents :-).

    >>> res = app.get('/tweet_engine/')
